# atypical_doseresponse_classifier
This repo comprises a *novel* method to identify atypical dose-response curves using a Convolutional Neural Network trained from simulation data. Most of the implementation is aimed at 7-dose response curves and aim to predict hermetic transition points.

# data
Data for training and testing the CNN can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bF-OeHiamdALTz2jKnEzqkbnq_rBEBxl?usp=sharing).
    This is a synthetic dataset, prduced using the methods described in [synthetic_doseresponse_generator](https://github.com/nathanieljevans/synthetic_doseresponse_generator)
